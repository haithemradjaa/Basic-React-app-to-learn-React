// We're creating a react component here


function Message() { // naming fucntions with PascalCasing following the convention
    
    // here we describe how the UI should look like when we use this component
    // for example, it renders this :

    return <h1>hello world</h1>;

    // This type of code is called JSX : js XMl that will be compiled to js code, you can check its equivalent in js on babeljs.js/repl

}

// to use it, we wanna explore it as a default object from this module, what does that mean ?
